                there is a solar power plant, extra high voltage substations (The voltage is the highest in Indonesia), there is a dam, there is a cave to enter an accessible power plant. Although it is only one 
                location, but there's a lot to learn. 
                Related courses are Energy and Analysis, System Analysis because you have to understand the 
                characteristics of electricity in Indonesia, then Power Electronics, Power System Protection or 
                Energy Protection courses, and System Engineering, totaling 12 credits. Then if they want to 
                take part in the practicum, I suggest taking a 2-credit practicum course called Power Engineering Laboratory, so total credits to be 14`
